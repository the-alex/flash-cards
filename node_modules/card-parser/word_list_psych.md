Conditioning :: A kind of learning that involves associations between environmental stimuli and responses.
Unconditioned Stimulus (US) :: Elicits the unconditioned response.
Unconditioned Response (UR) :: Response which is automatically produced.
Conditioned Stimulus (CS) :: Originally neutral stimulus that elicits a behavior after being paired with a (US).
Conditioned Response (CR) :: Response elicited by the conditioned stimulus.
Acquisition :: Phase of Classical conditioning when the US and CS are paired together.
Extinction :: repeat the conditioned stimulus without the unconditioned stimulus over time and the conditioned response will disappear.
Spontanious Recovery :: After a response has been extinguished it may reappear spontaniously.
Higher Order Conditioning :: Pairing a neutral stimulus with the conditioned stimulus will create another conditioned stimulus although a weaker conditioned response. More liely to show extinction.
Simulus Generalization :: After a stimulus becomes a conditioned stumulus for some response, other similar stimuli may produce the same reaction.
Stimulus Discrimination :: One learns to realize the differences between similar stimuli.
Thorndike :: Studied cats to understand learning behaviors.

Neutral Consequence :: Not more or less likely to see behavior patterns change.
Reinforcement :: Anything which will make a response more likely to occur.
Primary Reinforcers :: Satisfy biological needs (food, water, sex). Presentation increases the likelyhood of repeating the behavior.
Secondary Reinforcers :: Satisfy through association with primary reinforcers (money, praise, grades). Presentation incerases the likelihood of repeating the behavior.
Punishment :: Presentation or removal of a stimulus that decreases the liklihood of a response.
Positive Punishment :: Something occurs (a stimulus is presented) to decrease a behavior response.
Negative Punishment :: Something is removed to decrease a bhavior response.
Continuous [Learning Schedule] :: Reward/punishment occurs each time the behavior occurs.

Variable Ratio Schedules [Learning Schedule] :: Re/inforcement after some average number of responses (on average 7x)
Fixed Interval [Learning Schedule] :: Reinforcement occurs after a fixed amount of time has passed since the reinforcer __presented the stimulus?__.
Variable Interval [Learning Schedule] :: Reinforcement if a variable amount of time has passed since the previous reinforcer __administered the stimulus??__.
Shaping :: Reinforcing bahavioral tendencies in a desired direction. Uses sucessive approximation-- reinforce responses that are increasingly similar to the desired behavior.

Motivated Forgetting :: Painful memories blocked from consciousness. (Freud)
Retrieval Cues :: Contexual information helps memory.
Encoding specificity :: A cue can help as a reminder when it recreates the specific way the information/memory was encoded. States and context can influence memory.
Amnesia :: Refers to memory deficits.
Retrograde Amnesia :: Deficit in recalling events that happened before the onset of amnesia.
Anterigrade Amnesia :: Deficit in learning after the onset of the disorder.
Post-traumatic Amnesia :: Range of cognitive impairments including memory loss following an accident. Can be substantial __?__.
Childhood Amnesia :: The inability to remember things from the first years of life.
