Developmental Psychology :: Universal aspects of lifespan development from conception through death. Identifies cultural variations.
Germinal Phase :: Conception to 2 weeks
Zygote :: A fertilized egg. Divides and ompants itself in the wall of the uterus.
Placenta :: Structure that allows oxygen and nutrients to pass into fetus from mother's bloodstream. Allows waste to pass out.
Embryonic Stage :: (2 - 8 Weeks). Head, face and neck develop. Buds for limbs form and grow. Maor organs / digestive system differentiating. Heartbeat Begins.
Fetal Stage :: 8th week of prenatal development and onward.
Prenatal Development (Phases of development) :: Germinal Phase (Conception - 2 weeks) -> Embryonic Stage -> Fetal Stage
Lanugo :: Fine, wooly hair over the body.
Vernix :: Waxy coating that collects on the surface of the child.

Cephalocaudal :: "Top to bottom" motor skills emerge from head to feet.
Proximodistal :: "Inside-to-outside rule" motor skills emerge in a  sequence of center moving outward.
Teratogens :: Harmful toxins that affect development resulting in defect, damage or anomaly. The degeree to which teratogens will affect an infant can be determined by dose, age of child upon exposure, genetics, interaction with environment like stress, nutrition, or lack of medical care.
Consequences of Stress on a Prenatal Child :: Prolonged stress linked with prematurity at birth.
Consequences of Drug Use on Prenatal Child :: 
Thalidomide :: Chemical given to mothers during pregnancy for morning sickness that was later linked to grossly underdeveloped limbs and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The negative effects of the drug eventually led to more structured drug regulations and development.
Affects of Smoking on Prenatal Children :: Tobacco is a mild stimulant, which causes increased fetal activity. Low birth weitght, perceptual and attentual problems, and increased chance of SIDS.
Affects of Marijuana on Prenatal Children :: Low birth weight, disturbed sleep in newborns, reduced attention to environment.
Affects of Heroin on Prenatal Children :: Premature birth weight, tremulous behavior, poor sleep, poor sucking and feeding, risk of SIDS.
Affects of Cocaine on Prenatal Children :: Premature size/weight, tremulous, high pitched crying, respiratory and regurgitation problems, rigidity, withdrawal symptoms, deformities.
Comoribidity :: The presence of one or more additional disorders co-occurring with a primary disease or disorder.
Physical Affects of Alcohol on Prenatal Children :: Alcohol is the leading teratogen in the United States. Causes growth retardation, head and facial abnormalities, mircrocephaly, skeletal, brain and heart damage.
Behavioral Affects of Alcohol on Prenatal Children :: Poor impulse control, poor attention, hyperactivity and cognitive deficits.
Fetal Alcohol Effects :: Some symptoms of FAS, but fewer physical symptoms (ARND).
Vision in Infants :: Poor fixation ability. Limited ability to discriminate color. Estimated visual acuity of between 20/200 ad 20/400. Preference for human faces.
Hearing in Infants :: Fetus can hear sounds around 6 months in utero. Recognizes mother's voice.
Taste and Smell in Infants :: Both present at birth. Preference for sweet things.
Touch in Infants :: Heat, cold, pressure and pain all present at birth.
Reflexes in Infants :: Inborn, automatic responses to a particular form of stimulation.
Rooting Reflex :: Survival value, stroke cheek and baby will turn head toward the stimulation.
Stepping Reflex :: Basis for complex motor skills. With bare feet touching the floor an infant will mimic a steping response. Disappears around 2 months.
Sucking Reflex :: Place a finger in mouth and baby will suck. Permits feeding.
Eyeblink reflex :: Shine a bright light or clap. They will close eyelids. Protects from strong stimulation.
Babinski Reflex :: Stroke the heel to see reactions of the toes which flex/fan out. Normal in infants. If it persists, can indicate neurological problems.
Gross and Fine Motor Development :: Individual children will differ, but the normative expectations for these skills and abilities are often called milestones. Many cross-cultural similarities have been identified.
Gender Differences in Child Development :: Boys ahead of girls in force and power. Girls ahead in fine motor and gross motors skills which involve good balance.
Temperament :: Relatively constant basic disposition which is inherent in a person that underlies and modulates his/her behavior.
Thomas and Chess :: Identified three basic temperaments for infants. Difficult, slow to warm, and easy.
Difficult (Infant Behavior) :: Often wail, cry, and are negative in new situation, eat and sleep irregularly.
Slow-to-Warm-Up (Infant Behavior) :: Often inactive, adapt slowly and can be withdrawn and show a negative mood.
Easy (Infant Behavior) :: Cheerful, adaptive, easily establish routines.
Goodness of Fit :: The match between the characteristics of the infant and his/her family is critical to development. Some are better matches than others.
Attachment :: The bond that children may form with a caregiver.
Stranger Anxiety :: Develops when infants are around 6-7 months ending around 18 months. If a stranger approaches, the infant becomes afraid and reaches for the caregiver for comfort and reassurance.
Securely Attached :: Child uses the parent as a safe base to explore. When separated, the child may not cry during absence but will seek contact when the parent returns. Decrease crying if parent present (60% of US infants)
Avoidant Attachment :: Unresponsive to parent when present, no disstress when they leave. React to stranger similar as to parent. Slow to greet parent when she returns. (20% of US infants)
Ambivalent/Resistant Attachment :: Seek closeness wiwth their parents. Fail to explore. Upon return display angry resistant behavior. Cannot be comforted. (15% of US infants)
Disorganized/Disoriented Attachment :: Greatest amount of insecurity. In reunion show disorganized. Confused behaviors. Mothers are more avoidant and inconsistent with a lack of sensitivity to infant's needs. (5% of US infants)
Authoritarian (Baumrind Parenting Style Research) :: Restrictive parenting. Insist on obedience. Preschoolers were moody. Easily annoyed. Unfriendly and less motivated.
Authoritative (Baumrind Parenting Style Research) :: Assume control with flexibility. Reasonable demands. Provide reasons for rules/decisions. Preschoolers were cheerful, social reasonable. Achievement oriented and cooperative.
Permissive (Baumrind Parenting Style Research) :: Accepting and lax with few demands. Preschoolers were impulsive, aggressive, bossy, self centered, low in independence and achievement.
Uninvolved (Maccoby Parenting Style Research) :: Removed or hostile parenting. Overwhelmed with own stressors. Have little time or energy to parent. Children of this parenting style are high in aggression, temper tantrums, perform poorly in classroom.
Attachment and Contact Comfort :: Hypothesized that animals/humans need warmth, comfort as a primary need.
Developmental Theories as Stage Theories :: Individual 
Frustration :: When the pursuit of a goal is prevented.
Stress :: Any circumstance that threatens or is percieved to threaten one's well being.
Conflict :: Two or more competing and incompatible goals appear.
Approach-approach conflicts [Three Types of Conflicts] :: a choice must be made between two desirable goals. The least stressful type of conflict.
Avoidance-avoidance Conflict [Three Types of Conflicts] :: A choice must be made between two unattractive goals.
Approach-avoidance Conflict [Three Types of Conflicts] :: A choice must be made about to achieve a goal which has both positive and negative attributes.
Change :: Any noteable difference in one's life which requires adaptation. Both positive and negitive life changes can be stressful.
General Adaptation Syndrome :: All types of stressful situations lead to a similar stress response consisting of three stages.
Alarm [General Adaptation Syndrome] :: The body releases adrenal hormones, sympathetic nervous system.
Resistance [General Adaptation Syndrome] :: Body is on 'high alert'
Exhaustion [General Adaptation Syndrome] :: Increased physiological vulnverability to stress.
Stressors :: Specific events or chronic pressures that place demands on a person and/or threatens well-being.
Coping :: What strageties you use to buffer against the stress cycle. Active efforts to master, reduce or accept the demands created by stress.
Repressive coping :: avoiding the situation or thoughts of the stressor.
Rational coping :: Facing a stressor and working to overcome it.
Displaced Aggression [Maladaptive Coping Strategies] :: Harmful act to someone verbally or physically, who is not actually the true “object” of the hostility.
Catharsis [Maladaptive Coping Strategies] :: Realse of emotional tension.
Self-Indulgence [Maladaptive Coping Strategies] :: Compensate for depreived/frustrated feelings by trying to promote a feeling of satisfaction in another area.
Constructive Coping Strategies :: healthy efforts to deal with a stressful event making one more resilient to the stressor(s)
Humor :: The use of humor can help cope with stress; can defuse some situations
Relaxation :: Reduces tension by relaxing muscles in the body, slowing cortical activity, heart rate, respiration and blood pressure
Social Supports :: Presence of social supports provide adaptive coping/release from pressures. Further underscores the benefits of family dinners.
